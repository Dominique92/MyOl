Dominique92.MyOl
================
This package intent to make you able to implement an [OPENLAYER MAP](https://openlayers.org/) in your own website.

SIMPLE EXAMPLE
==============
This [EXAMPLE DEMO](https://dominique92.github.io/MyOl/) implements a single map with the most current maps layers providers.
You can download the [DISTRIBUTION ZIPPED PACKAGE](https://github.com/Dominique92/MyOl/archive/master.zip) and unzip it in your website FTP section.
See the [FULL HTML EXAMPLE CODE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dominique92/MyOl/master/index.html)
You can include the includes, css & javascript sections of this example on your own page (adjust the include files path to your implementation)
If you want to use the France IGN, Microsoft BING & OSM thunderforest map layers, you must acquire a free key and replace it in the html (see source comment)
